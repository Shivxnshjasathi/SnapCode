# UI Design to Code Generator

## Overview

**UI Design to Code Generator** is a Streamlit-based web app that converts UI design images into fully functional code. By leveraging Google's Gemini AI (`gemini-1.5-flash`), the app analyzes a given image and generates both HTML/CSS code, as well as Flutter code, for seamless implementation of the UI.
